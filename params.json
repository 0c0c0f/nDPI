{"name":"nDPI","tagline":"Open Source Deep Packet Inspection Software Toolkit","body":"### Welcome to nDPI\r\nDeep packet inspection (DPI) is a technique that allows you to identify application traffic protocol such as SSH, HTTP, WhatsApp or Facebook, simply dissecting the first few packets. In addition to that it can extract attributes such as the HTTP URL or DNS query.\r\n\r\nThere are many DPI toolkits available on the market, but they are closed, costly and usually not available in source format. For this reason we have developed nDPI. We wanted it free (LGPL v3), open and available in source format so you can see what we do with your packets and make sure that your privacy is respected.\r\n\r\nCurrently it supports almost 200 protocols. While we do our best to keep nDPI updated as new protocols are introduced, we need your help. Please contribute!","google":"UA-129330-01","note":"Don't delete this file!
